# Apple Store Reviews Analysis

This repository contains the Week 12 project for WsCube Tech's Data Analytics Program. The objective of this project is to perform statistical analysis on a dataset of Apple Store product reviews. The analysis involves descriptive and inferential statistics to draw meaningful insights from the data.

## Dataset

The dataset contains Apple Store product reviews and is available at the following link: [Apple Store Reviews Dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NfhChTBqxuhjY05zsUV0oQjWb0bO18mD/view?usp=sharing)

## Objective

As a Data Analyst, you will apply key statistical concepts to:

1. Analyze the central tendency, spread, and relationships in the data.
2. Identify patterns and insights from the dataset.
3. Perform hypothesis testing and sampling analysis.

## Analysis Steps

### 1. Descriptive Statistics
- **Central Tendency**: Calculate the mean, median, and mode of the app ratings.
  - Determine which measure best represents the central tendency.
- **Spread**: Find the range and interquartile range (IQR) of the `Purchase_Amount`.
  - Understand how these values describe the spread of the data.
- **Variance and Standard Deviation**: Calculate these for the number of likes received on reviews.
  - Interpret the standard deviation to understand the data's variability.

### 2. Correlation Analysis
- Determine the correlation between the number of likes and the app ratings.
  - Identify if there is a positive, negative, or no correlation between these variables.

### 3. Distribution Analysis
- Plot the distribution of app ratings.
  - Identify whether the distribution is positively or negatively skewed.
  - Interpret the skewness to infer user satisfaction levels.

### 4. Hypothesis Testing
- Perform a hypothesis test to check if the average rating for Instagram is significantly higher than the average rating for WhatsApp.
  - Use a 95% confidence level.

### 5. Sampling and Central Limit Theorem
- Take random samples of ratings from the dataset and calculate their means.
- Create a sampling distribution and relate it to the Central Limit Theorem.

## Tools and Libraries

- **Python**: Used for data analysis and statistical computations.
- **Libraries**:
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn
  - Scipy

## Insights and Results
- Detailed insights and results will be documented after completing the analysis.
- Each step of the analysis will include a clear explanation of methods and findings.

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository.
2. Download the dataset using the link provided.
3. Ensure the required libraries are installed:
